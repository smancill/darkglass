# darkglass

This is a fork of the original colorsqueme inkpot.vim, created by Ciaran McCreesh.
You can check it [here]( http://github.com/ciaranm/inkpot).

A darkish scheme which works in the GUI and in some 88 color terminals (urxvt, for example)
and 256-color terminals (xterm with `TERM=xterm-256` seems to work).
This won't work in regular 8/16 colour terms,
and depending upon your setup you may need to sacrifice a few goats to get the 88/256 things to work.

I am using this colorsqueme in a transparent urxvt,
so I have removed the background color for the terminal,
and changed some colors to make them darker.
